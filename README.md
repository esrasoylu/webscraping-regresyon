## Machine Learning with Web Scraping Methods: Weather Forecasting Using Polynomial Regression

One of the crucial methods for accessing and analyzing large amounts of data nowadays is web scraping. In this article, we will learn how to gather data from websites using the Python programming language and the BeautifulSoup library, a popular tool for web scraping.

Since weather conditions can significantly impact various fields, we embarked on a polynomial regression study to predict future weather based on approximately 17,000 rows of data obtained through web scraping.

The project stages are explained step by step. Enjoy reading!
